## What Software Engineering Means to Me

To me, software engineering has a few different levels to it when I think of it.  The first level is the problem / demand level, meaning
someone encounters an everyday problem they need fixed or a business has a demand for a certain type of software.  Moving on to the next
level, I believe there is a brainstorming phase in which different solutions / approaches are came up with in order to solve said problem.
The first solution is generally not the most efficient solution in regards to time- and space-complexity, so the succeeding levels of 
software engineering is maximizing the efficiency of the algorithms / data structures implemented.  Once there is an acceptably efficient
solution presented, the final level of software engineering is to implement your solution via the gateway of coding, and from there 
debugging any problems / logical errors present.  While I don't believe the solution has to be the most efficient, it should be efficient
for large datasets.
